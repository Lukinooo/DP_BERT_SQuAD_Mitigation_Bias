Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites. During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward reduction in the number of the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6.

Manufacturing processes are identical regardless of weight. In fact, pressing lightweight records requires more care. An exception is the propensity of 200 g pressings to be slightly more prone to non-fill, when the vinyl biscuit does not sufficiently fill a deep groove during pressing (percussion or vocal amplitude changes are the usual locations of these artifacts).

He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy. Whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another. Today Whitehead's philosophical works â€“ particularly Process and Reality â€“ are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.</td>\n","      <td>As opposed to physical objects, what did Whitehead believe reality is composed of?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['processes'], 'answer_start': [306]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <td>572c101b2babe914003c298a</td>\n","      <td>God</td>\n","      <td>The last centuries of philosophy have seen vigorous questions regarding the arguments for God's existence raised by such philosophers as Immanuel Kant, David Hume and Antony Flew, although Kant held that the argument from morality was valid.

Some theists agree that none of the arguments for God's existence are compelling, but argue that faith is not a product of reason, but requires risk. There would be no risk, they say, if the arguments for God's existence were as solid as the laws of logic, a position summed up by Pascal as \"the heart has reasons of which reason does not know.\" A recent theory using concepts from physics and neurophysiology proposes that God can be conceptualized within the theory of integrative level.</td>\n","      <td>How does Alvin Plantinga describe faith?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['\"properly basic\"'], 'answer_start': [329]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["show_random_elements(datasets[\"train\"])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"n9qywopnIrJH"},"source":["## Preprocessing the training data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YVx71GdAIrJH"},"source":["Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them.
