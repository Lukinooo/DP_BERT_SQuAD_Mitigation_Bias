In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).</td>\n","      <td>How many days is the incubation period for woodpeckers?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['10 days'], 'answer_start': [685]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>57279468dd62a815002ea109</td>\n","      <td>Gramophone_record</td>\n","      <td>Flexible or so-called \"unbreakable\" records made of unusual materials were introduced by a number of manufacturers at various times during the 78 rpm era. In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise. In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success. Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long. The contemporary French PathÃ© Cellodiscs, made of a very thin black plastic, which uncannily resembles the vinyl \"sound sheet\" magazine inserts of the 1965â€“1985 era, were similarly short-lived. In the US, Hit of the Week records, made of a patented translucent plastic called Durium coated on a heavy brown paper base, were introduced in early 1930. A new issue came out every week and they were sold at newsstands like a weekly magazine. Although inexpensive and commercially successful at first, they soon fell victim to the Great Depression and production in the US ended in 1932. Related Durium records continued to be made somewhat later in the UK and elsewhere, and as remarkably late as 1950 in Italy, where the name \"Durium\" survived far into the LP era as a trademark on ordinary vinyl records. Despite all these attempts at innovation, shellac compounds continued to be used for the overwhelming majority of commercial 78 rpm records during the lifetime of the format.</td>\n","      <td>What was a common problem found in early flexible records?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['surface noise'], 'answer_start': [361]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>57110322b654c5140001fabd</td>\n","      <td>Age_of_Enlightenment</td>\n","      <td>One of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education. Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured \"to make information available to the greatest number of people.\" As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies. More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. Sir Isaac Newton's celebrated Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular.</td>\n","      <td>Which ideal endeavoured to make information available to the greatest number of people?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['Popularization'], 'answer_start': [508]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>57318f17497a881900249036</td>\n","      <td>Steven_Spielberg</td>\n","      <td>Rejecting offers to direct Jaws 2, King Kong and Superman, Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about UFOs, which became Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).

It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, Vilmos Zsigmond, and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, 1941, a big-budgeted World War II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4 million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.</td>\n","      <td>How many Oscars did Close Encounters win?</td>\n","      <td>{'text': ['two'], 'answer_start': [451]}</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>56dedfc3c65bf219000b3d9e</td>\n","      <td>Arnold_Schwarzenegger</td>\n","      <td>In 2012, Schwarzenegger helped to found the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which is a part of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California.
