       "{'context': \"Andrew Lloyd Webber , Baron Lloyd-Webber ( born 22 March 1948 ) is an English composer and impresario of musical theatre . \\n \\n Several of his musicals have run for more than a decade both in the West End and on Broadway . He has composed 13 musicals , a song cycle , a set of variations , two film scores , and a Latin Requiem Mass . Several of his songs have been widely recorded and were hits outside of their parent musicals , notably `` The Music of the Night '' from The Phantom of the Opera , `` I Do n't Know How to Love Him '' from Jesus Christ Superstar , `` Do n't Cry for Me , Argentina '' and `` You Must Love Me '' from Evita , `` Any Dream Will Do '' from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and `` Memory '' from Cats . \\n \\n He has received a number of awards , including a knighthood in 1992 , followed by a peerage from Queen Elizabeth II for services to Music , seven Tonys , three Grammys ( as well as the Grammy Legend Award ) , an Academy Award , fourteen Ivor Novello Awards , seven Olivier Awards , a Golden Globe , a Brit Award , the 2006 Kennedy Center Honors , and the 2008 Classic Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music . He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , is an inductee into the Songwriter 's Hall of Fame , and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters , Composers and Authors . \\n \\n His company , the Really Useful Group , is one of the largest theatre operators in London . Producers in several parts of the UK have staged productions , including national tours , of the Lloyd Webber musicals under licence from the Really Useful Group . Lloyd Webber is also the president of the Arts Educational Schools London , a performing arts school located in Chiswick , West London . He is involved in a number of charitable activities , including the Elton John AIDS Foundation , Nordoff Robbins , Prostate Cancer UK and War Child . In 1992 he set up the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts , culture and heritage in the UK . \\n \\n Early life \\n \\n Andrew Lloyd Webber was born in Kensington , London , the elder son of William Lloyd Webber ( 1914–1982 ) , a composer and organist , and Jean Hermione Johnstone ( 1921–1993 ) , a violinist and pianist . His younger brother , Julian Lloyd Webber , is a renowned solo cellist . \\n \\n Lloyd Webber started writing his own music at a young age , a suite of six pieces at the age of nine . He also put on `` productions '' with Julian and his Aunt Viola in his toy theatre ( which he built at Viola 's suggestion ) . Later , he would be the owner of a number of West End theatres , including the Palace . His aunt Viola , an actress , took him to see many of her shows and through the stage door into the world of the theatre . He also had originally set music to Old Possum 's Book of Practical Cats at the age of 15 . \\n \\n In 1965 , Lloyd Webber was a Queen 's Scholar at Westminster School and studied history for a term at Magdalen College , Oxford , although he abandoned the course in Winter 1965 to study at the Royal College of Music and pursue his interest in musical theatre . \\n \\n Professional career \\n \\n Early years \\n \\n Lloyd Webber 's first collaboration with lyricist Tim Rice was The Likes of Us , a musical based on the true story of Thomas John Barnardo . Although composed in 1965 , it was not publicly performed until 2005 , when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber 's Sydmonton Festival . In 2008 , amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association ( NODA ) in association with the Really Useful Group . The first amateur performance was by a children 's theatre group in Cornwall called `` Kidz R Us '' .
